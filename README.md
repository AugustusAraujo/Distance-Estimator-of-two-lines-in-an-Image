# Distance-Estimator-of-two-lines-in-an-Image
The program is used to measure the distance between two lines in an image. Uses OpenCV image processing tools to extract two lines from real image, finds the region of interest and estimates the distance between the lines in real world coordinate based on the calibration information (length/pixel).
